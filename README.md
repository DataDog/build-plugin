## ‚ú® Key takeaways ‚ú® <!-- omit in toc -->

-   This is a bundler plugin (webpack for now, others to come...).
-   It monitors plugins, loaders, hooks, dependencies, modules, chunks, ...
-   It doesn't add runtime.
-   Very easy to setup and disable on the fly.
-   Totally extendable thanks to a hook architecture.

## Installation

During the beta, [refer to this document](./BETA_INSTALLATION.md).

-   Yarn

```bash
yarn add @datadog/build-plugin
```

-   NPM

```bash
npm install --save @datadog/build-plugin
```

## Usage

Inside your `webpack.config.js`.

```js
const BuildPlugin = require('@datadog/build-plugin/webpack');

module.exports = {
    plugins: [new BuildPlugin()],
};
```

**üìù Note: It is important to have the plugin in the first position in order to report every other plugins.**

## Configuration

The Build plugin accepts many options:

### `disabled`

> default: `false`

Plugin will be disabled and won't track anything.

### `output`

> default: `true`

If `true`, you'll see a top 5 of all metrics tracked by the plugin.
If a path, you'll also save json files at this location:

-   `dependencies.json`: track all dependencies and dependents of your modules.
-   `metrics.json`: an array of all the metrics that would be sent to Datadog.
-   `stats.json`: the `stats` object of webpack.
-   `timings.json`: timing data for modules, loaders and plugins.

## Integrations

### `datadog`

> default: `null`

An object used to automatically send your build data to Datadog.

The most basic configuration looks like this, consult
[the full integration documentation](./hooks/datadog) for more details.

```javascript
new BuildPlugin({
    datadog: {
        apiKey: '<mydatadogkey>',
    },
});
```
